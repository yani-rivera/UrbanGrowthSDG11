# Synthetic / Fantasy Data

All example listings included in this repository are **entirely fictional**.

They are provided solely to:
- demonstrate pipeline execution,
- validate configuration and scripts,
- enable full reproducibility without exposing real data.

Any resemblance to real properties, prices, locations, or entities is coincidental.

Synthetic data follows the same structural and formatting rules as real inputs,
but does not represent actual housing markets.
